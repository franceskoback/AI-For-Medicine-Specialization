    "    'n_estimators': [10, 20],\n",
    "    'max_depth': [2, 5],\n",
    "    'min_samples_leaf': [0.1, 0.2],\n",
    "    'random_state': [0]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can generate a list like this:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "[[10, 20],\n",
    " [2, 5], \n",
    " [0.1, 0.2]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can get all combinations of the hyperparameter values:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "[(10, 2, 0.1),\n",
    " (10, 2, 0.2),\n",
    " (10, 5, 0.1),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed the hyperparameters into an random forest model, you can use a dictionary, so that you do not need to hard code the parameter names.\n",

    "RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators= 20, max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=0.2)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the values in both the list of tuples and list of dictionaries are in the same order as the original hyperparams dictionary.  For example, the first value in each is n_estimarors, then max_depth, and then min_samples_leaf:\n",
